Haram Safe is a reliability-driven crowd management system for Masjid al-Haram. It estimates live crowd density from diverse sensors, self-checks those estimates using two independent analytics channels, 
and—when a safety threshold is crossed—an independent protection service issues automatic actions (Close, Reroute, One-Way, signage/PA). Operators always retain manual override.

Reliability is tracked with Availability (AVAIL), POFOD (probability of failure on demand), ROCOF (false-alert rate), 
and p95 detection latency, with strict targets during peak periods.

Why does this matter now. Peak-hour density can rise faster than humans can perceive and coordinate.
A few seconds of delay can turn heavy congestion into crush-risk. 
Haram Safe’s design makes fast, predictable responses possible even during partial outages.
